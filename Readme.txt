## 🧪 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/burgess-glay/BurgTech.git
   cd BurgTech
   ```

2. If you're using a local server (XAMPP/WAMP):
   - Move the project folder to your `htdocs` directory
   - Open `http://localhost/BurgTech` in your browser

3. The contact form (`contact.php`) will only work when hosted on a PHP-supported server.
